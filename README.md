# Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 1

## Investigate a Dataset (TMDb)

This exploratory data analysis project is one of the projects in the Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree course.
It is a simple and basic data analytics project aimed at exploring and analysing The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset to gain some insights into the dataset, and also present those insights graphically.

## Preview

The TMDb dataset has some interesting characteristics about movies released from 1960 to 2015.

The actual exploration analysis and visualization of the dataset together with the conclusions can be found in the accompanying `Jupyter Notebook`. To preview the notebook, open the `Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb` file to in a `Jupyter Notebook`. This file also contains all the narratives, including the conclusions, of the project. The `tmdb-movies.csv` file contains the actual dataset which was explored and analysed.

## Features

- Data Gathering
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualizations (mostly univariate data visualizations)

## Futher Works

- [ ] Add some bivariate and multivariate data visualizations to make get interesting insights
- [ ] Enhance the visualizations with advanced libraries and tools
- [ ] Separate the code from the reports to make presentation stand out
